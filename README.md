# Atari Breakout Clone - Games Module Assignment

This repo contains assets relevant to the clone of the Atari's Breakout game completed as part of the Games Module at Aberystwyth University. 

Notice, the uploaded files represent only the barebone of the project, in particular the script files and some of the key sprites. The Windows build of the game is provided under *builds* folder. If you would like me to provide other builds or the full project for you to build it yourself, please get in touch.
